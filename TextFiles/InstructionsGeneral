Welcome to Power Plant Simulator, In this game you will become a Power Plant Manager
and you will take control of either a Nuclear plant, a Hydroelectric Dam, a Solar
farm, or a Coal plant. The object of the game is to have the highest total scores
by the end of 2030 when you retire as manager. You are scored in the game based off 
of the amount of money invested into your plant, your public relations with the 
customers you supply, the power production that your plant produces, and finally the 
board score which is the score that reflects how well you are keeping your employers 
happy. Each year you will have to set a budget that allows you to allocate funds to
different sectors of your plant to keep your score up and each year there is a 
random event that can hurt your score. Based off your budget and your assistant 
manager you will either win or lose the event. Well lets begin!
