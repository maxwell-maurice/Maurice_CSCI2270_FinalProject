Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using
photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). Commercial
concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s and are still 
being developed and refined today. For several years, worldwide growth of solar PV
was driven by European deployment, but has since shifted to Asia, especially China 
and Japan, and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world 

	Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40% per year since 2000 and 
total installed capacity reached 139 GW at the end of 2013 with Germany having the 
most cumulative installations (35.7 GW) and Italy having the highest percentage of 
electricity generated by solar PV (7.0%). In 2010, the International Energy Agency 
predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3,000 GW or 11% of projected 
global electricity generation by 2050—enough to generate 4,500 TWh of electricity.
 Four years later, in 2014, the agency reassessed their long-term predictions, 
rising estimates for solar power to 27% of global electricity generation by 2050 
(16% from PV and 11% from CSP). 

	Photovoltaic systems use no fuel and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. 
The cost of installation is almost the only cost, as there is very little maintenance 
required. Installation cost is measured in $/watt or €/watt of peak power. As of 
2011, the cost per watt of PV has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is 
set to fall further. The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the 
Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011, and a 
decline to prices below $2.00/watt seems inevitable. 

	Some media sources have reported that solar power plants have injured or 
killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat. This adverse effect only applies 
to concentrated solar power plants however, and some of the claims may have been 
overstated or exaggerated.
