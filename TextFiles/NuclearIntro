Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactors to release nuclear energy, and
thereby generate electricity. Along with other sustainable energy sources,
nuclear power is a low carbon power generation method of producing electricity.
As of 2012, according to the IAEA, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power
reactors under construction in 15 countries. 

	The United States produces the most nuclear energy, with nuclear power 
providing 19% of the electricity it consumes. In terms of lives lost per unit of 
energy generated, nuclear power has caused  fewer accidental deaths per unit of 
energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation. Energy produced 
by coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per unit of 
energy generated, from air pollution and energy accidents, However public outcry 
of Nuclear energy production is still very high causing opinion poles of Nuclear 
energy to be at the bottom of the list. 

	Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster,Japanese authorities 
have shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants, but it has been estimated that 
if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas 
plants would have caused more lost years of life. In terms of fuel cost nuclear is 
one of the cheapest, but due to safety regulations it is still very expensive to 
maintain.
